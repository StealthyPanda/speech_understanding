# Speech Understanding Assignment 1

This repo contains all my hardwork for the first assignment submission.

This code implements STFT from scratch, and generates spectrograms using various windowing techniques, with easy extending of additional windowing techniques.

The code is all organised in a single file, [audiolib.py](./audiolib.py).

An interactive version showcasing these is in [the example notebook](./example.ipynb).


I wanted to implement more stuff, but I ran outta time.
